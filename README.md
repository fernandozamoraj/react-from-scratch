this project was created using the instructions found in
https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658

The one change I made was to not specify package versions (e.g babel-preset instead of babel-preset@6.2.1)

to use you must have node installed

run this from the command line

git clone https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/react-from-scratch.git

cd react-from-scratch

npm install

got your browser and navigate to localhost:3000
